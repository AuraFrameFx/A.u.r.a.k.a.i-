My new Android app remembers everything you do (locally!)

Tired of AI assistants that forget your context every conversation? I built AuraKai - an AI companion that actually remembers you.

**What it does:**
- Maintains context across all interactions
- All processing happens on your device (no cloud)
- System-level ad blocking and privacy protection

**Built for privacy:**
Your data never leaves your device. No corporate surveillance. True local-first AI.
